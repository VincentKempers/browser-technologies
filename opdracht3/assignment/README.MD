# Contactlist
This is a contact list where you can search see a little bit of information on hover and on click you have more detailed information about the contact.
This simple "app" doesn't really use complex design. You look up what you need click on the contact and you view extra information.

All data is collected via FakerJS and can dynamically updated. When the server restarts there is new data.

_Note: I probabl/maybe should have experimented more! Due to time constraints I didn't made crazy enhancements._

_vw vmin vh vmax support_

![Transistions]( docAssets/transitions.png)
_support CSS3 transitions_

![grid]( docAssets/grid.png)
_support display: grid_

# Fallbacks

Fonts

```CSS
@font-face {
  font-family: 'openSans-bold';
  src: url('fonts/OpenSans-Bold.eot'); /* IE9 Compat Modes */
  src: url('fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf')  format('truetype'); /* Safari, Android, iOS */
}
```

Scroll behaviour / `@supports`

```CSS

@supports (scroll-behavior: smooth) {
  * {
    scroll-behavior: smooth;
  }
}

```

* flexbox

```CSS
element {
/* for older browsers IE9 and down the line */
  display: block;
  float: left;
  margin: 0 auto; /* or display: table;  */
/* older browser will not understand flex and ignore it.
Newer browsers wont */
  display: flex;
}
```

* My feature deteection for add `.attachEvent`

```JS
if (document.getElementById && document.getElementsByTagName && document.attachEvent) {
  var input = document.getElementById("myInput");
  input.attachEvent('onkeyup', myFunction);

  function myFunction() {
    var input = document.getElementById("myInput");
    var filter = input.value.toUpperCase();
    var ul = document.getElementById("myUL");
    var dd = ul.getElementsByTagName("dd");
    for (var i = 0; i < dd.length; i++) {
      var a = dd[i].getElementsByTagName("a")[0];
      if (a.innerHTML.toUpperCase().indexOf(filter) > -1) {
        dd[i].style.display = "";
      } else {
        dd[i].style.display = "none";
      }
    }
  }
}
```
_Note: the application actually better this way i noticed bugs when I did it diffrently but this actually supports ie8 perfectly_

# ES6 fallback

snippet from: [https://www.bram.us/](https://www.bram.us/2016/10/31/checking-if-a-browser-supports-es6/)

```JS
var supportsES6 = function() {
  try {
    new Function("(a = 0) => a");
    return true;
  }
  catch (err) {
    return false;
  }
}();

if (supportsES6) {
  var script = document.createElement("script");
  script.src = "my-es6-file.js";
  document.head.appendChild(script);
}
```

Unfortunatly this didn't work for me so i re-wrote everything back to ES5.




# Browser tests
Ways of testing:
* My own windows machine: Internet Explorer 11 & 10/ Mozilla Firefox/ Google Chrome
* [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/)
* Device Lab

## Browser support
Because of the low Javascript usage are there only some CSS fallbacks needed to be created.
* Usage of `display: flex;` & `display: grid;`.

### Internet explorer

#### Notes
* On IE7 it works for the most part only the part that doesn't really work is the onclick.
* `visibility: hidden;` didn't work on IE7
* On IE8 I really didn't want to do that much crazy things but for what it's worth, it WORKS :tada:.
* On IE9 it's a bit of the same experience on ie8 but it actually works a bit smoother. Details still don't work properly but if you go on a details page you actually want to see everything.
* On IE10 Animations start to work now! You can see the progression on the page. Filter works properly and you view everything.
* On IE11 it's the same experience mostly but you get a hint of the middle browser experience. You can click and it will open the quick view version.
* On Microsoft Edge I found no problems and it works just as great!

### Firefox

### Notes
* It works!
* The emulation ran a bit slow so i couldn't really tell if there were animations. _But to be safe_ browser doesn't really support animations but it works solid.

_Note: The Opera mobile emulator didn't work for me anymore so i couldn't test on Opera Mini and/or Opera Mobile_

# Accessibilty

I tried to keep focus on colours. I used different blues and made use of a lot of white colours. I personally think that it works well.
#### programs i used:
- [sim daltonism](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sim-daltonism/id693112260)
- [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/)
- [aXe Chrome Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd)

### Some results:

# What i have learned
* ES6 support that didn't work for me.
* I noticed that the fallback could be tricky sometimes.
* The existence of `attachEvent`
* proper use of fallbacks
